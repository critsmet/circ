        Circular is a community events board for people over the internet, conceptualized by <a href="https://www.jessehlebo.com/">Jesse Hlebo</a> and <a href="https://critsmet.github.io/bio">Chris Metzger</a> in the winter of 2018 and launched in 2021.

        We noticed that the dopamine gratification from notification-based applications was glueing us to our devices more than ever, while the awareness of our data being collected and big tech's power to infiltrate society deepened our cognitive dissonance. One reason in particular has kept us from ultimately cutting ourselves off: fear of missing out.
        <br/><br/>
        When deciding where to go on a Friday night, we addictively scroll through our feeds, dodging selfies and memes, trying to find something to do. Workshops, protests, and community organizing events are promoted on platforms that often work against the very goals that people are mobilizing for, simply because there's no real alternative. With their selective, non-linear algorithms that show you flyers for events that happened days ago, most social media applications aren't really built for sharing goings-on anyways. Do people even use Facebook for events anymore?
        <br/><br/>
        We wanted to build something without all of the traps of contemporary social media applications;Â a non-addictive website that's lets you determine the extent to which you want to interact with it. Whether you've been waiting for something like this to finally get you off of Instagram, or you just vibe with the concept of a no-frills online space to peruse or plug what's going on in your corner of the world, we hope you find this simple site useful.
        <br/><br/>
        All you need in order to contribue is an email address and an event to share.
